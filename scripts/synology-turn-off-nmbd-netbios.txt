This is over a year old, but as it is the thread Google points too but has no answer, here is the answer I got from Synology support:

https://kb.synology.com/en-id/DSM/tutorial/How_to_login_to_DSM_with_root_permission_via_SSH_Telnet

TLDR?:

- Enable SSH on your Synology

- SSH in with admin account

- type "sudo -i" and hit enter, you may be prompted for your password again

- for 6.2 type "stop nmbd"

- for 7.0 type "

systemctl stop pkg-synosamba-nmbd (this stops the service)

then type

systemctl disable pkg-synosamba-nmbd (this prevents the service from starting after a restart)

"

The note mentions that this will work until after the SMB service package is updated which then defaults back to having the service enabled.
